## Food Delivery Console App (C#)

This is a **simple C# console-based Food Delivery application** built to understand **OOPS concepts and collections**.

The app allows users to:

* Dynamically enter multiple food delivery records at runtime
* Store delivery details such as **Name, Location, and Item**
* Use a **List collection** instead of a fixed-size array
* Display all entered deliveries using a **for loop**

### Concepts Used

* Classes & Objects
* Constructors
* Dynamic collections (`List<T>`)
* `for` loop iteration
* User input handling
* Basic console output

This project is created for **learning and practicing core C# and OOPS fundamentals**, similar to how real food delivery apps manage multiple orders internally.
